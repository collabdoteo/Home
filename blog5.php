						<h2 style="margin-top: 40px;font-weight: bold;">Trends: The Effects on Creator's Sustainability</h2>
                        <p>Social Media almost every day seems to be finding some kind of trend or challenge shining in their discovery area. 
                            But we all know how these discovery areas work. Hit the algorithm and you are now shining bright like a street 
                            lamp for stranger, the viewers. Earlier these trends used to be special, occasional or just different. And, if
                             you make content around them wisely, you can be trending with the trend as a creator too. But, today, it’s a 
                             pit of many trends. One single choice can make you have million likes or maybe just another “Meh” Content

                        </p>
                        
                        <p>What we will be covering here is, how to have sustainable growth through trends and just not get wild with it.
                        </p>  

                        <p>
                            <h3 style="font-weight:bold;">Test the water of trends</h3>
                        </P>
                        
                        <p>Trends allow you to create something different for your followers and your community. They make you push yourself 
                            out of your comfort zone, push your creative mind and make you more aware of the things happening around your 
                            market. Hitting on trends allows the content creators to attract new audiences who are into niche style of themes.
                             These creative flows are always based on certain themes, like the Jeff Bezos TikTok and IG Reels (Original Song

                        <p>Following the right trends also gives a fresh perspective about you, how you feel, the comforts you are ready to 
                            push for creating amazing content. This draws your community to not have a monotonous perspective about you or 
                            your content, but flow with a nice change of time and a fresh look, like a twist in a love story Ocean’s Eleven

                            long run, a sustainable growth. Sometimes instant fame may not fall in your side

                        </p>

                        <p> Isn't it fascinating for us how much content we can consume on an average? 
                        </p>

                            “As of 2019 and 2020, the average daily social media usage of internet users worldwide amounted to 145 minutes per day, up from 142 minutes
                             in the previous year”</a> Quotes Statista.com
                            </p>

                        <p>
                            And, this just pushes our creators to create something they love to distribute to the masses. And, sometimes being trendy does hit the right spots for them. 
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            But, how much trendy content is going to be useful for them. Ideally this may impact negatively to the portfolio too, heavily (being the operative word here). 
                        </p>

                        <p>Portfolio becoming too trendy also over shadows your original content. This leads to losing touch over your real 
                            identity of who you as a creator on the platform. Not hitting the right trends, which suits your vibe, or just a 
                            tad bit different (doing too much) might also pollute your portfolio. Your community builds on the sanity of your 
                            work, even insanity too, but wisely. The creator, you, starts playing with the hot fire of sustainability.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If done right, it's all about building your community and also engaging the new audience to make them recurring on 
                            your pages. The strength of your community defines the growth of your portfolio on any said platform. 
                            <br>
                            Be wise of what you want to test and play around with. We are not perfect and can dabble with wrong trends too.
                             What we can do is learn and grow together
