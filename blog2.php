						<h2 style="margin-top: 40px;font-weight: bold;">Creators and Communities: Why Their
                            Survival depends on Co-Existence</h2>
                        <p>Content Creators today are churning heavy on a lot of aspects being a small business themselves.
                            One of them is building a strong community. If we look into things closely, the basic economics which
                            we observe around us never changes. For Example, when we want to buy groceries, priority is to buy
                            the necessities. Once we reach the rack, our eyes straight away look for the brand we have been
                            using on a regular basis. And, if we can’t see it, we do get a bit uncomfortable. But how did we as
                            consumers start following that single brand in itself? So many things get factored in making that
                            particular decision </p>

                        
                        <p>In this article we will be looking into those aspects of how they are directly linked to building a
                            community for content creators, and its sheer utilisation</p>

                            <i>Fan meeting of Put Your Head on My Shoulder series</i></a>
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>
                            <ol>
                                <li>
                                    <h4 style="font-weight: bold;">Relevance</h4>
                                    <p>This is something which attracts the consumer. Are you supplying what is the need of the
                                        market, as of now, or have been for a long time?
                                        <br>
                                        The relevance of your presence plays a vital role in tapping the market. We always hear
                                        mixed reviews about Walmart. You like it or not, we are always relieved to have one around
                                        us. The community needs a safe and cheap grocery marketplace to buy as many things as
                                        possible. Walmart is creating awareness about how you will always find one around you. Its
                                        relevance is associated with its locality and variety of items it sells
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Same goes for the creators. When you create your content, it is always scaled on two
                                        aspects, long term and short term, or as we say, just trend worthy. Your content’s relevance
                                        is tested on its longevity. How are you reaching the right people irrespective of what the
                                        trend you are on?
                                        <br>
                                        The communication, design, relevant motive around the said genre plays key roles in
                                        retention of the user on your profile.
                                    </p>

                                </li>

                                <br>
                                
                                <li>
                                    <h4 style="font-weight: bold;">Consistency</h4>
                                    <p>We as a consumer, or as a human in general will always appreciate the things we love to stay
                                        the same for a longer course. Our human mind cannot sustain with continuous change.
                                        Because, when a viewer is consuming your content, they are always consuming for the peace
                                        they crave in that time. Like, when you step out to get yourself a Bagel, ideally you would
                                        always prefer to go at the same lorry. This allows your mind to settle down on the exact taste
                                        you have been habitual of now.<br>
                                        The consistency of the quality of content and the same time period of it being posted, slowly
                                        allows the consumer to stay connected. We as humans have evolved with television.
                                        <br>
                                        Television Networks always telecast shows at the same time every week and maintain story
                                        lines until you are up for some dramatics. Everyone has grown up like this. And, now it is
                                        heavily wired in our system. To look for a consistent outlook for peace. Our lives are already
                                        so chaotic that consumers will like to stay with you, to feel sane and look out for the day and
                                        time of your content release.
                                    </p>

                                </li>
                                
                                <br>
                                
                                <li>
                                    <h4 style="font-weight: bold;">Quality</h4>
                                    <p>This is the crucial aspect to build your community. Slowly and steadily building a range of
                                        good quality content. This should reflect in your work by the passage of time. The set of
                                        content you produce is like your very own portfolio, it defines you. This also means exploring
                                        new ways to create content, trying different ways to make your content more relevant and
                                        having a consistent push towards growth. Community is built over belief and the
                                        word-of-mouth spreads over time. But, this can sustain the amount of time you spend on
                                        making something beautiful.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Pull up your socks, being a content creator is amazing, it’s beautiful, and the love from your
                                        own community will always make you smile bright.
                                    </p>
