						<h2 style="margin-top: 40px;font-weight: bold;">What Is Creator Economy?</h2>
                        <p>Creator Economy, which is also termed as Gig/ Passion Economy is a new catch phrase nowadays for
                            the people who are monetizing their interests. Turning your audience into a strong community of
                            your own to engage with is like creating your own cult, an Identity.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>For example, you are a full time Software Developer, and in your free time you are also a Graphic
                            Designer. What would be the next best thing? To engage with the audience and monetize your work,
                            right? This allows the said person to have a nice blanket of extra earnings for the week or month.
                            Keeping their lives afloat and comfortable, which leads to Passion Economy.
                        </p>  

                        
                        <p>Since 2018, this has finally caught some speed with Conventional Economy, thanks to the
                            revolutionization of the Internet across the globe.
                            </p>

                        <p>At present, as reported by <u><a href="https://signalfire.com/blog/creator-economy/" target="_blank">Singal Fire</a></u>,
                            approximately 4% of the total existing Creators are
                            Professionals, and the rest 96% are Amateurs who are hustling this as side business. This particular
                            statistic itself confirms the power of Content Creation which is uplifting so many individuals across
                            many homes.
                            
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>The year 2020 pushed so many talented individuals in their homes for longer than general 8-10
                            hours, Pre-Pandemic. This nutshell created space for exploration, growth, more time for oneself,
                            leading to creation of a strong influx of aspiring content creators. Platforms have helped many
                            people, especially the younger generation, to use them as a way to express themselves, their
                            emotions, thoughts, opinions, beautiful stories, and so forth.
                            </p>

                        <p>Today, making an Instagram Reel takes no more than 20
                            min, same goes with TikTok.
                            People took advantage of
                            this, and more are working
                            on creating it as a sustainable
                            side hustle. For example, one
                            person I know works in a
                            corporation. In mid-2020, she
                            started her Business
                            Instagram Page for her
                            paintings, which now stays
                            active with 10k followers, and
                            growth chart seems to be
                            only upwards.
                            </p>

                        <p>
                            The online platform has given an outlet to so many people to express, to thrive, to generate content
                            which they always wanted to do.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            This wave of creation has also been because of major consumption of the said art. In general terms,
                            what we have learnt in our school days, Supply and Demand. The demand for consumption of digital
                            art is nowhere near to be slowing down anyway soon. This has boosted people around the globe to
                            create more. Not only that, but the way MainStream Media is now investing in Content Creators to
                            collaborate and work with them to share their product across the market has also taken a steep rise.
                            Media Houses, Corporates are now more aware of how people are consuming information these
                            days, through social media. Artists are sponsored by Guitar Manufacturer to perform on one of the
                            reels, YouTube Video with there product, so as it can reach a mass consumer base, beyond
                            boundaries of geo location. This helps both the creator to earn money, and Companies to build a
                            market in the Creators Community.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Creator Economy is solely based on creating your own community, a niche but your own, like an
                            Identity. This allows creators to open multiple avenues to engage with them through Merchandises,
                            Offers, Sales, Meet-Ups, Collaboration, and much more. Creators can negotiaṣte with the world
                            through their size of the community they build and truly work as a small business.
