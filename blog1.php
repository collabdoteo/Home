						<h2 style="margin-top: 40px;font-weight: bold;">The New Cultural Uprising: Creator Economy </h2>
                        
                        <p>The year 2020, taught everyone a lot about themselves. The lockdowns were imposed, resources were getting 
                            slim day by day, everyone was forced to stay inside. In all this chaos the only shining light everyone 
                            could find around was within themselves. The entire world halted and this created a lot of time for every 
                            individual. Not only time was in action, even the suppressed passions also went onto pushing themselves 
                            out of the cans which were put in the dark by many. The startling of cans led to one of the biggest booms 
                            observed in the recent history of economics, The Digital Creator Space. </p>
                        <br>
                        
                        <h4><strong>History of Content Creation</strong></h4>
                        
                        <p>Digital Creators have been around us for a good 15 years now, since the inception of YouTube. The craze of 
                            creation on Internet was/is well supported by Instagram, Twitter, and now recently TikTok.</p>  

                        
                        <p>Year 2005 saw the release of a Video sharing platform which was not looked upon by many in the early stages. 
                            Everyone seemed to be trying to get the hang of internet space back then. As the years went by, this 
                            platform started gaining traction across the globe. Yet, Creators on this platform were not quite looked 
                            up to as an aspiration by young generation. For everyone, it was just like any other trend which would 
                            age by its time and move away.</p>

                        <p>Today, YouTube by the end of 2021 expects its revenue to be around <u><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesbusinessdevelopmentcouncil/2021/08/30/the-continuous-growth-and-future-of-the-creator-economy/?sh=4eb97d517c9c" target="_blank">$30 Billion</a></u>,
                             alone as per Frobes.
                            Few took the gamble then, and are ripping its fruits now. The Top 1% of the creators today belong to 
                            the early-stage creatorsâ€™ generation on these platforms.
                        </p>

                        
                        <p>When the world took a pause, everyone started exploring themselves again. This led to an increasing 
                            number of beautiful creations being posted, used and shared, Online, and now Offline.</p>

                        <p>The time in hand allowed so many individuals to monetize their craft. Leading to being a part time 
                            creator, or full-time creator as small businesses themselves. Today around <u><a href="https://www.newyorker.com/culture/infinite-scroll/what-the-creator-economy-promises-and-what-it-actually-does" target="_blank">$1.3 Billion</a></u> have been 
                            invested on Creators and Platforms in the year 2021, leading to one of the biggest infusion of 
                            monetary in any industry.</p>

                        <p>
                            This uprising culture of Content Creators is now very well known as <strong>Creator Economy</strong>
